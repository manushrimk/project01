      <marquee><h1><i>WHITE CAKE</i></h1></marquee>  
       <h3>White cake is a simple one, featuring a fine, moist crumb. It is commonly used for weddings, birthdays and other special occasions. It is made like most plain cakes, but the big difference is egg whites are used. This gives white cake its characteristic pure-white coloring.
       The exact origin of white cake is unknown. Cakes have a long history dating back to ancient Greece and Rome, where flat heavy “cakes” were sacrificed to gods. Cake was interchangeable with bread until the middle ages, when it started being used for special occasions. Cakes were seen as a symbol of wealth and were much heavier than they are today. However, the industrial revolution and the introduction of chemical leavening agents such as baking soda and baking powder made them lighter and simpler to bake. The mass production of ingredients also helped lower costs. Cake quickly became a common and favorite dessert.
